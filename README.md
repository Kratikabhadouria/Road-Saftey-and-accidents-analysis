# Road-Saftey-and-accidents-analysis
## The objective of road safety and accidents analysis is to systematically identify trends and patterns in accident data to understand when and where accidents are most likely to occur. It aims to determine the primary causes and contributing factors behind these incidents, such as driver behavior, road conditions, and environmental influences. By assessing the severity and impact of accidents, the analysis seeks to propose effective measures for reducing their frequency and severity. This information is crucial for developing and informing policies, regulations, and educational initiatives aimed at enhancing overall road safety and preventing accidents. Ultimately, the goal is to create safer roads and reduce the number of accidents, thereby saving lives and reducing economic and social costs associated with road traffic accidents.
